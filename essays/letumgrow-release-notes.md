For the past several weeks I have not made significant progress adding functionality to LetUmGrow, mostly some minor css tweaks, fixing some conflicts in Github, and figuring out how to self deploy. Last semester, I had trouble explaining what my plans for LetUmGrow were, so instead of rushing headfirst into programming, I wanted to clarify the goals I had for this app. So I decided to write out more of what I wanted to do and fit those goals into a timeline. In the interim between the previous and current semesters, I also wanted to do more research on similar apps. I found a plant identification app called Pl@ntNet which is used to identify plants by images taken by users. I would like to try contacting them in the future to see if future collaboration would be possible. However they are based in France so that could interfere with the communication process.
<br><br>

### Future Features
In the next couple of weeks once I have satisfactory goals and plans, I will be making LetUmGrow more user friendly, so that the plant map is easier to use. I will also be implementing different user roles like admin and general user. That way I will be able to keep features used for testing separate from features for general users. During testing, there had been a lot of confusion over that.
