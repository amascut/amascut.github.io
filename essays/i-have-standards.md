For a while, I’ve been curious about coding standards in different organizations. How do successful tech companies like google organize their code? I’ve used their standards in previous website projects, but it seems like many times good standards are unclear or hard to find.

I see great value in coding standards; they provide order and improve collaboration and compatibility between different systems.

I like the way code standard checking is automated in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA. The way an IDE streamlines and automates so many aspects of programming is very helpful.

Some of the standards in the .eslintrc files contrast with my style, but also make me rethink how I should code. Sometimes I like to add spaces between parentheses nested in other parentheses, and the eslint file flags uses of that practice. If I can figure out my own standard, I could probably create my own eslint file.
