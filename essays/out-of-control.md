My first experience with Github was during the 2015 AT&T Hackathon. I remember one of the speakers was very passionate about development and crossfit. Though I struggled to take in all the different development tools mentioned, I learned a great deal.

Throughout my experiences with various files and projects, Iâ€™ve found great value in the version control aspect of configuration management. Without version control, my files of the same iterated projects can quickly get confusing, with unwieldy names and crowded folders. I get paranoid that I will overwrite a working copy with an edit that breaks my code, and without being able to revert the file, I would have to frantically search for errors.
