The origin of the idea behind LetUmGrow began years ago on hikes that I would take with my dad. He usually brought photocopies of pages of the trail guidebook he owned. Occasionally, he would also bring his Hawaiian plant guide book. With both of these resources, he was often able to give lots of background information about the trail including information on the plants found on certain parts of the trails.

As I grew older, I still had an appreciation for hiking the trails of Hawaii. But due to my minimalist style of hiking I try not to carry much with me besides my water bottle and phone and end up not being able to easily identify plants.

LetUmGrow was originally going to be a plant identification app (with a the dream goal being able to identify plants using a mobile devices camera a la QR Codes and Facebook facial recognition).

App idea proposal

Collaboration with UH Building and Grounds

Building the app

Broadening focus

This web app serves as a database of plant data linked with their locations on a map. Users can add new plants they find, edit profile pages of existing plants, and edit their personal profile pages. Also included is an information page on remedies that incorporate Hawaiian Medicine and local plants.
